Planted a couple of Himalayan White Birch trees


We have extended our little birch copse with two Himalayan White Birch trees *Betula utitis var. jacquemontii*. They are quite mature standards so it remains to be seen whether they will take an thrive. We have done all the right things: lots of Rootgrow; a big hole, back-filled with compost rich soil mixture, lots of water.

As a counterpoint to the white-barked birch we also put in a black-barked flowering cherry (well ornamental plum) *Prunus cerasifera var. Pissardii Nigra*.
